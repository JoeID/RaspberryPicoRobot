# RaspberryPicoRobot

I made a robot from scratch (without using a kit) ; I chose and bought the components then used 2mm and 4mm thick aluminium sheets to make the structure of the robot.

It is controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, the code of which can be found on this repo (main.py).

It has a Bluetooth antenna so I programmed an Android app in Kotlin to control it. The code can be found in the Edwina folder (yes, because the robot is named Edwina).

The whole project is described here : http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/joel.charles-rebuffe/public_html/2021/11/08/robot-bluetooth-diy/
